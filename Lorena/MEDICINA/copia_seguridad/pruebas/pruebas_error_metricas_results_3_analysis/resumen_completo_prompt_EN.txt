Explanation: Option 1 describes the role of a nurse manager, option 2 describes the concept of nursing diagnosis itself, and option 3 describes the holistic approach of nursing diagnosis. Only option 4 does not match the characteristics of a Nursing Diagnosis, which is to identify an actual or potential human response to health problems and/or processes, rather than providing standardized language for use in Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

Explanation: The other options are all relevant norms for standardizing sensitive results related to nursing practice. Option 1 suggests that the labels or descriptions of results should be concise and clear, making it easier to understand the findings. Option 2 emphasizes the importance of describing specific nursing behaviors or interventions, allowing for accurate comparisons and analysis. Option 4 highlights the need for consistent definitions across measurement scales, ensuring that the results are reliable and comparable.

Option 3, however, does not make sense in the context of standardizing sensitive results related to nursing practice. The phrase "conceptualizarse y exponerse en niveles medios de abstracción" is unclear and seems unrelated to the topic of standardization.

Vitamin D metabolism involves the conversion of vitamin D from its inactive form (cholecalciferol) to its active form (calcitriol). This process occurs in the skin (under sunlight exposure), which converts vitamin D into calcidiol, and then in the small intestine, where calcidiol is converted into calcitriol. Therefore, the correct answer is "Piel e intestino delgado" (Skin and small intestine).

Benzodiazepines interact with hydrazine (hidroxicina in Spanish) to potentiate their depressant effects on the Central Nervous System (Sistema Nervioso Central). Hydrazine is a potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine. By blocking the action of monoamine oxidase, hydrazine allows these neurotransmitters to accumulate in the synapse, enhancing the effects of benzodiazepines on the CNS.

This change in criteria achieves a decrease in false positives, as the new threshold of 126 mg/dL reduces the number of individuals who would be misdiagnosed with diabetes based on elevated blood glucose levels. This means that more people will not be incorrectly diagnosed as having diabetes when they do not actually have it.

This is because when diagnosing a severe disease with invasive measures and serious potential side effects, the primary characteristic we would look for in a diagnostic test is one that can accurately identify individuals who truly have the disease (true positives). An elevated positive predictive value (PPV) indicates that if the test result is positive, there is a high likelihood that the individual actually has the disease. This is crucial to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions.

During pregnancy, there is an increase in plasma volume and blood volume due to the demands of fetal growth. This leads to a decreased plasma osmolality, which can result in a decrease in water reabsorption in the kidneys, ultimately increasing the total body water content. As a consequence, the volume of distribution of a medication like paracetamol would not increase during pregnancy.

According to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a score of 3 indicates that the patient has a severe head injury or encephalic trauma, with signs of decreased consciousness and no response to verbal stimuli, pain, or light. The patient's ability to flex their arm in response to pain suggests some level of brainstem function, but the unreactive pupil on one side suggests a possible lesion in that area.

The patient's blood pressure dropped significantly from 140/80 mmHg to 85/50 mmHg, which is a sign of hypotension (low blood pressure). Given that the patient gained 2Kg during hemodialysis, it is likely that the excessive removal of fluids and electrolytes contributed to this drop in blood pressure. Therefore, option 4, "Temperature del líquido de diálisis elevada" (Elevated dialysate temperature), is unlikely to be the cause of hypotension.

This patient group has had an acute myocardial infarction (IAM) and are initially considered low-risk for sexual activity if they have no symptoms during moderate physical activity starting from the first week after the event. The other options do not meet this criteria: patients with a DAI (implanted cardioverter-defibrillator) may require special precautions, those with severe heart failure (NYHA III-IV) are typically considered high-risk for sexual activity, and asymptomatic patients with valvular disease may still be at risk due to the underlying cardiac condition.

This is because in the Volumen Control (VC) mode, the ventilator maintains a constant volume delivery regardless of the patient's inspiratory effort. In contrast, in the Pressure Control (PC) mode, the ventilator adjusts the delivered volume based on the patient's inspiratory effort, so that the pressure in the airway remains constant. Therefore, if the patient increases their inspiratory effort, it would reduce the pressure in the airway in VC mode and increase the volume circulate in PC mode.

This patient has a capillary glucose level of 485 mg/dl, which indicates hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). Additionally, the ketone level is 0.4 mmol/l, which suggests that they have some degree of ketoacidosis. However, the ketone level is not extremely high, so it's classified as moderate rather than severe or grave. Therefore, option 3, hyperglycemia with moderate ketoacidosis, is the most accurate description of this patient's condition.

The correct answer is option 2.

This is because the pump infusion set does not need to be changed every 3 days. The frequency of changing the infusion set depends on various factors, such as the type of tubing used, the flow rate of insulin delivery, and individual tolerance. Typically, the infusion set should be changed every 3 days or according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The other options are incorrect:

Option 1 is incorrect because analogues of long-acting insulin (such as abasaglar or levemir) would not be used in a pump reservoir, which delivers short-acting insulin.

Option 3 is incorrect because the duration of action of fast-acting insulin analogues can vary depending on the specific product and individual factors, but it typically takes several hours to reach its peak effect (around 1-2 hours) and lasts for around 4-6 hours.

Option 4 is incorrect because type 1 diabetes itself carries a risk of ketoacidosis, regardless of whether the patient uses an insulin pump or not. However, proper use of an insulin pump can actually reduce the risk of ketoacidosis by allowing more precise dosing and better glucose control.
