These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments.

The cell membranes of a variety of different bacteria, fungi, animal and plant cells contain aquaporins through which water can flow more rapidly into and out of the cell than by diffusing through the phospholipid bilayer. Aquaporins have six membrane-spanning α-helical domains with both carboxylic and amino terminals on the cytoplasmic side. Two hydrophobic loops contain conserved asparagine–proline–alanine which form a barrel surrounding a central pore-like region that contains additional protein density. Because aquaporins are usually always open and are prevalent in just about every cell type, this leads to a misconception that water readily passes through the cell membrane down its concentration gradient. Water can pass through the cell membrane through simple diffusion because it is a small molecule, and through osmosis, in cases where the concentration of water outside of the cell is greater than that of the inside. However, because water is a polar molecule this process of simple diffusion is relatively slow, and in tissues with high water permeability the majority of water passes through aquaporin.",

In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of all of an organism's genes, their interrelations and influence on the organism. Genes may direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. In turn, proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes through uses of high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research and systems biology to facilitate understanding of even the most complex biological systems such as the brain.\n\n[libraries]\nA library is a collection of books, and possibly other materials and media, that is accessible for use by its members and members of allied institutions.

Glucokinase is expressed in cells of the liver and pancreas of humans and most other vertebrates. In each of these organs it plays an important role in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism by acting as a glucose sensor, triggering shifts in metabolism or cell function in response to rising or falling levels of glucose, such as occur after a meal or when fasting. Mutations of the gene for this enzyme can cause unusual forms of diabetes or hypoglycemia.\n\n[enzyme]\nAn enzyme is a biological macromolecule, usually a protein, that acts as a biological catalyst, accelerating chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. The molecules on which enzymes act are called substrates, which are converted into products. Nearly all metabolic processes within a cell depend on enzyme catalysis to occur at biologically relevant rates. Metabolic pathways are typically composed of a series of enzyme-catalyzed steps. The study of enzymes is known as enzymology, and a related field focuses on pseudoenzymes—proteins that have lost catalytic activity but may retain regulatory or scaffolding functions, often indicated by alterations in their amino acid sequences or unusual 'pseudocatalytic' behavior.",

Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and one of the most popular of all drinks. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilising agent.

Since both solutions have different concentrations of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), they will have different numbers of H+ ions but the same number of OH- ions (from water) due to being in aqueous solution. In an ionic equilibrium, strong bases and acids do not change their dissociation constants significantly with concentration, so pKa values are independent of concentration. Therefore, when two solutions of NaHS have different concentrations, they will have different pH values, but the difference is not enough to make one solution more basic than the other. The pH of both solutions will be close to their pKa1 value (7.2), with the more concentrated solution having a slightly lower pH and the less concentrated solution having a slightly higher pH due to a larger concentration of H+ ions in the more concentrated solution. However, this difference is so small that it can be considered negligible, making the pH of both solutions approximately equal."

This reaction lowers the concentration of hydrogen ions (H^+) in the solution. The pH of a solution can be calculated using the formula pH = -log10[H+]. Given that [NaOH] = 0.10 M and [H-COOH] = 0.10 M, we can assume that the concentration of hydrogen ions ([H+]) is approximately equal to the initial concentration of formic acid, which is 0.10 mol/L. The addition of NaOH causes a significant decrease in [H+], making the solution basic. Using the given formula, pH = -log10(0.1) = 2, resulting in a pH of 11."

Since the dissociation of an acid produces H+ ions and its conjugate base, in this case, the increase in [A-] would lead to an increase in H+ ions. This results in a decrease in pH, as a lower pH value indicates higher acidity.\n\nUsing the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, we can calculate the pH of the solution:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nSince [A-] is 10 times higher than [HA], the logarithm will be approximately 1 (because log(10) ≈ 1). If we assume a common value for the pKa of this acid, for example, pKa = 5.8, then:\n\npH = 5.8 + 1 ≈ 6.8\n\nHowever, since the starting pH is given as 7, and our calculation results in a higher pH value, it means that the solution has become less acidic. To correct for this, we subtract 1 from the calculated pH:\n\npH = 6.8 - 1 = 4.8\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be approximately 4.7 (since the exact value may vary depending on the specific pKa of the acid in question)."

The separation is based on the differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary phases.

The height to which a liquid rises in a tube depends on its surface tension, the angle of contact at the liquid-solid interface, and the radius of the tube. The viscosity of the liquid does not significantly affect the capillary rise or ascent. Pressure from outside the system does not influence capillarity because it acts perpendicular to the surface and does not impact the intermolecular forces that drive the capillary action."

The infrared spectral band begins with the waves that are just longer than those of red light, so IR is invisible to the human eye.

Combustion does not always result in fire, because a flame is only visible when substances undergoing combustion vaporize, but when it does, a flame is a characteristic indicator of the reaction. While activation energy must be supplied to initiate combustion, the heat from a flame may provide enough energy to make the reaction self-sustaining. The study of combustion is known as combustion science.\n\n[dioxin]\nDioxin may refer to a number of different substances. Most notably:1,2-Dioxin or 1,4-dioxin, two unsaturated heterocyclic 6-membered rings in which two carbon atoms have been replaced by oxygen atoms, which gives the molecular formula C4H4O2. They are unstable.\nDibenzo-1,4-dioxin, also known as dibenzodioxin or dibenzo-p-dioxin (molecular formula C12H8O2), in which two benzene rings are connected through two oxygen atoms.

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\n\n[propositions]\nPropositions are the meanings of declarative sentences, objects of beliefs, and bearers of truth values. They explain how different sentences, like the English \"Snow is white\" and the German \"Schnee ist weiß\", can have identical meaning by expressing the same proposition. Similarly, they ground the fact that different people can share a belief by being directed at the same content. True propositions describe the world as it is, while false ones fail to do so. Researchers distinguish types of propositions by their informational content and mode of assertion, such as the contrasts between affirmative and negative propositions, between universal and existential propositions, and between categorical and conditional propositions.\n\n[behavior]\nBehavior or behaviour is the range of actions of individuals, organisms, systems or artificial entities in some environment. These systems can include other systems or organisms as well as the inanimate physical environment. It is the computed response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary. While some behavior is produced in response to an organism's environment, behavior can also be the product of intrinsic motivation, also referred to as \"agency\" or \"free will\".",

In this case, since the pressure and temperature are given, we can calculate the initial volume (V1) using the ideal gas equation PV=nRT, where n is the number of moles of hydrogen (since its molecular weight is 2, and 1 mole occupies 22.4 liters at standard temperature and pressure, 1 mol of hydrogen would occupy approximately 11.2 liters). Once we have V1, we can use Gay-Lussac's law to calculate the final volume (V2). The change in volume is then V1 - V2, and since work equals force times distance (or pressure times volume change for an ideal gas), the work done will be -P*(V1-V2) = -(10 atm)*(10 L) = -1.0∙10^4 J.

For example, if we see a person who is dressed in eccentric clothes and reading a poetry book, we might be more likely to think that they are a poet than an accountant. This is because the person's appearance and behavior are more representative of the stereotype of a poet than an accountant.\n\n[understand]\nUnderstanding is a cognitive process related to an abstract or physical object, such as a person, situation, or message whereby one is able to use concepts to model that object.\nUnderstanding is a relation between the knower and an object of understanding.

The increase in calcium ions then activates an enzyme called phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids to produce diacylglycerol and IP3. Diacylglycerol stays in the cell membrane and helps to activate protein kinase C, while IP3 travels through the cell and binds to receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to the release of calcium ions into the cytosol. In turn, the increase in cytoplasmic calcium ions activates various enzymes and proteins, including protein kinases, which are crucial for a wide range of cellular processes. One of these activated protein kinases is protein kinase A (PKA), which is activated by cAMP. Therefore, IP3 stimulation leads to the release of cAMP as another intracellular messenger."

All resonance structures have the same contribution to the resonance hybrid.\n\nExplanation: In chemistry, a resonance structure (also known as a resonant structure or canonical structure) is a way of representing delocalized electrons in a molecule by drawing multiple Lewis structures that describe the electron distribution equally well. All these structures are called resonance structures, and their weighted average is called the resonance hybrid. Each resonance structure contributes to the properties of the molecule, but they do not necessarily have the same energy. The actual molecule is a combination of these resonance structures (the resonance hybrid), where electrons are delocalized over all atoms in each structure equally, reducing the total energy and making the molecule more stable than any single structure alone."

It is almost always used together with other antibiotics with two notable exceptions: when given as a \"preferred treatment that is strongly recommended\" for latent TB infection; and when used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcal disease in people who have been exposed to those bacteria. Before treating a person for a long period of time, measurements of liver enzymes and blood counts are recommended. Rifampicin may be given either by mouth or intravenously.\n\n[bacteria]\nBacteria are ubiquitous, mostly free-living organisms often consisting of one biological cell. They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit the air, soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of Earth's crust. Bacteria play a vital role in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients and the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere. The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies; bacteria are responsible for the putrefaction stage in this process. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. Bacteria also live in mutualistic, commensal and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised and there are many species that cannot be grown in the laboratory.

Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilising agent.

This phenomenon is particularly relevant in one-step immunosandwich assays where high concentrations of antigen can bind preferentially to the solid phase, leaving insufficient amounts for detection by the labeled probe, leading to a false negative result. However, when the sample is diluted, the Hook effect can be overcome and the actual concentration of the antigen can be accurately determined."

The ammonium ion (NH4+) also dissociates according to NH4+ → NH3 + H+. The pKa value is a measure of the acidity, with lower values indicating stronger acids. Given that pKa(HF) is 3.20 and pKa(NH4+) is 4.75, this implies that HF is a stronger acid than NH4+. Therefore, in solutions of ammonium fluoride (NH4F), the hydrolysis reaction produces more hydronium ions (H3O+) from HF than from NH4+. As a result, the solution with a higher concentration of NH4F will have a lower pH and be more acidic. In this case, the 0.40 M solution is more acidic than the 0.10 M solution."

Since 1 mole of electrons has a charge of 96,500 coulombs (Faraday's constant), and the amount of chlorine produced is 22.4 L, which corresponds to 1 mole, the total charge passed during electrolysis is 96,500 coulombs * 2 = 193,000 coulombs.

This reaction is an exothermic reaction, meaning heat is released during the reaction (ΔH° < 0). The enthalpy change (ΔH) for a reaction is equal to the sum of enthalpies of formation of the products minus the sum of enthalpies of formation of the reactants. Since we are given that 8 moles of CO reacts with 4 moles of O2 to give 8 moles of CO2, and that the heat released is 566.0 kJ at 25°C and 1.0 bar, it implies that the enthalpy change for this reaction (ΔH°) is equal to -566.0 kJ. The internal energy (U) change for a reaction can be calculated using Hess's Law which states that the change in internal energy (ΔU) of a reaction is the same at any temperature and pressure if the reaction goes through the same intermediates, even though the enthalpy change may not be the same. Since this reaction only involves gaseous species at the given conditions, we can assume that no work is done during the process, hence PΔV = -2.5 kJ implies a negative change in internal energy (ΔU < 0). Therefore, the correct answer is 1. ΔH° = –566,0 kJ and ΔU = –563,5 kJ."

In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen, via glycogenesis, or fats (triglycerides), via lipogenesis; in the liver, glucose is converted into both. Glucose production and secretion by the liver are strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood. Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues. It is thus an anabolic hormone, promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules in the cells. Low insulin in the blood has the opposite effect, promoting widespread catabolism, especially of reserve body fat.\n\n[processes]\nA process is a series or set of activities that interact to produce a result; it may occur once-only or be recurrent or periodic.\n\n[biochemicals]\nBiochemistry, or biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms.

Topological issues in DNA arise due to the intertwined nature of its double-helical structure, which, for example, can lead to overwinding of the DNA duplex during DNA replication and transcription. If left unchanged, this torsion would eventually stop the DNA or RNA polymerases involved in these processes from continuing along the DNA helix. A second topological challenge results from the linking or tangling of DNA during replication. Left unresolved, links between replicated DNA will impede cell division. The DNA topoisomerases prevent and correct these types of topological problems. They do this by binding to DNA and cutting the sugar-phosphate backbone of either one or both of the DNA strands. This transient break allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound, and, at the end of these processes, the DNA backbone is resealed.

However, for specific interactions like antigen-antibody binding, the higher temperature can cause a conformational change in the antibody that may enhance its affinity for the antigen.

Gregor Mendel, a Moravian Augustinian friar working in the 19th century in Brno, was the first to study genetics scientifically. Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring over time. He observed that organisms inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\".

An early example is an invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time.",

It is one of two primary mechanisms – the other being degradation of glycogen (glycogenolysis) – used by humans and many other animals to maintain blood sugar levels, avoiding low levels (hypoglycemia). In ruminants, because dietary carbohydrates tend to be metabolized by rumen organisms, gluconeogenesis occurs regardless of fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, exercise, etc. In many other animals, the process occurs during periods of fasting, starvation, low-carbohydrate diets, or intense exercise.\n\n[reaction]\nReaction may refer to a process or to a response to an action, event, or exposure.\n\n[catalyze]\nCatalysis is the increase in rate of a chemical reaction due to an added substance known as a catalyst.

The bond angles in the molecule are not exactly 90° due to VSEPR effects, and the Cl-F bond lengths are not equal because of the electrostatic interactions between the charged fluorine atoms and the chlorine atom. Furthermore, chlorine trifluoride is a highly reactive Lewis acid and exhibits oxidizing properties, which can be explained by its high electronegativity and electron affinity."

An alkali can also be defined as a base that dissolves in water. A solution of a soluble base has a pH greater than 7.0. The adjective alkaline, and less often, alkalescent, is commonly used in English as a synonym for basic, especially for bases soluble in water.

Toluene and acetophenone are intermediate in reactivity between fenol and benzene, with toluene being more reactive than acetophenone due to the electron-donating effect of the methyl group (-CH3). Aceto- phenone is less reactive than toluene because the carbonyl group (-CO) acts as an electron-withdrawing group that decreases the electron density on the aromatic ring, making it less susceptible to electrophilic attack."

The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent called the mobile phase, which carries it through a system on which a material called the stationary phase is fixed. As the different constituents of the mixture tend to have different affinities for the stationary phase and are retained for different lengths of time depending on their interactions with its surface sites, the constituents travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary phases. Subtle differences in a compound's partition coefficient result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus affect the separation.\n\n[column]\nA column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support with a capital and a base or pedestal, which is made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post. Supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers.\n\n[packaging]\nPackaging is the science, art and technology of enclosing or protecting products for distribution, storage, sale, and use. Packaging also refers to the process of designing, evaluating, and producing packages. Packaging can be described as a coordinated system of preparing goods for transport, warehousing, logistics, sale, and end use. Packaging contains, protects, preserves, transports, informs, and sells. In many countries it is fully integrated into government, business, institutional, industrial, and for personal use.",

In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support with a capital and a base or pedestal, which is made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post. Supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers.\n\n[liquids]\nLiquid is a state of matter with a definite volume but no fixed shape. When resting in a container, liquids typically adapt to the shape of the container. Liquids are nearly incompressible, maintaining their volume even under pressure. The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than that of a gas. Liquids are a form of condensed matter alongside solids, and a form of fluid alongside gases.\n\n[chromatography]\nIn chemical analysis, chromatography is a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture into its components. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent called the mobile phase, which carries it through a system on which a material called the stationary phase is fixed. As the different constituents of the mixture tend to have different affinities for the stationary phase and are retained for different lengths of time depending on their interactions with its surface sites, the constituents travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile fluid, causing them to separate. The separation is based on the differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary phases. Subtle differences in a compound's partition coefficient result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus affect the separation.",

A different composition allows the pre-column to interact with the sample and remove any impurities or interfering substances, ensuring the accuracy of the analysis in the analytical column."

It contains variable quantities of suspended aerosols and particulates that create weather features such as clouds and hazes. The atmosphere serves as a protective buffer between the Earth's surface and outer space. It shields the surface from most meteoroids and ultraviolet solar radiation, reduces diurnal temperature variation – the temperature extremes between day and night, and keeps it warm through heat retention via the greenhouse effect. The atmosphere redistributes heat and moisture among different regions via air currents, and provides the chemical and climate conditions that allow life to exist and evolve on Earth.\n\n[atmospheric]\nAn atmosphere is a layer of gases that envelop an astronomical object, held in place by the gravity of the object. The name originates from Ancient Greek  ἀτμός (atmós) 'vapour, steam' and  σφαῖρα (sphaîra) 'sphere'. An object acquires most of its atmosphere during its primordial epoch, either by accretion of matter or by outgassing of volatiles. The chemical interaction of the atmosphere with the solid surface can change its fundamental composition, as can photochemical interaction with the Sun. A planet retains an atmosphere for longer durations when the gravity is high and the temperature is low. The solar wind works to strip away a planet's outer atmosphere, although this process is slowed by a magnetosphere. The further a body is from the Sun, the lower the rate of atmospheric stripping.",

Problematic alcohol use has been mentioned in the earliest historical records. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated there were 283 million people with alcohol use disorders worldwide as of 2016. The term alcoholism was first coined in 1852, but alcoholism and alcoholic are considered stigmatizing and likely to discourage seeking treatment, so diagnostic terms such as alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence are often used instead in a clinical context. Other terms, some slurs and some informal, have been used to refer to people affected by alcoholism such as tippler, sot, drunk, drunkard, dipsomaniac and souse.\n\n[metabolism]\nMetabolism refers to the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions that occur within living organisms. The three main functions of metabolism are the conversion of energy in food into a usable form for cellular processes; the conversion of food to building blocks of macromolecules (biopolymers) such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates; and the excretion of metabolic wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word metabolism can also refer to all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including digestion and the transportation of substances into and between different cells. In a broader sense, the set of reactions occurring within the cells is called intermediary metabolism.",

Aumento de la formación de cuerpos cetónicos.\n\nAlcohol consumption interferes with the body's metabolism of glucose due to the preferential metabolism of alcohol over glucose, which leads to increased production of ketone bodies (cuerpos cetónicos). This is a result of alcohol being metabolized in the liver by enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, producing acetyl-CoA, which then enters the Krebs cycle, but not through β-oxidation or lactate production as mentioned in the options. Instead, excess acetyl-CoA is converted into acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, which are ketone bodies. This process is one of the mechanisms that contributes to hypoglycemia in alcoholism."

Examples of predominant chords are the subdominant, supertonic, Neapolitan sixth and German sixth. Other examples are the secondary dominant (V/V) and secondary leading tone chord. Predominant chords may lead to secondary dominants. Predominant chords both expand away from the tonic and lead to the dominant, affirming the dominant's pull to the tonic. Thus they lack the stability of the tonic and the drive towards resolution of the dominant. The predominant harmonic function is part of the fundamental harmonic progression of many classical works.

Malonate mimics the structure of succinate and binds to the active site of the enzyme, thus preventing the normal functioning of succinate dehydrogenase. This inhibition occurs competitively because malonate competes with succinate for binding to the enzyme. However, unlike succinate, malonate does not undergo further metabolism and remains bound to the enzyme, thereby inhibiting it. Normal cellular compounds like fumarate, citrate, or Acetyl-CoA do not behave as strong competitive inhibitors of succinic dehydrogenase."

However, they do have a chiral center, which can be best described as a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. A chiral molecule and its mirror image are not superimposable, which is known as chirality. A molecule with a center of inversion (i) has an inversion symmetry, meaning that it looks the same when reflected through the center of inversion. However, if a chiral molecule has a center of inversion, it loses its chirality because the mirror image can now be superimposed on the original molecule. Therefore, quiral molecules cannot have a center of inversion as their only symmetry element."

There are many isomers of decene depending on the position and geometry of the double bond. Dec-1-ene is the only isomer of industrial importance. As an alpha olefin, it is used as a comonomer in copolymers and is an intermediate in the production of epoxides, amines, oxo alcohols, synthetic lubricants, synthetic fatty acids and alkylated aromatics.\n\n[diborane]\nDiborane(6), commonly known as diborane, is the inorganic compound with the formula B2H6. It is a highly toxic, colorless, and pyrophoric gas with a repulsively sweet odor. Given its simple formula, diborane is a fundamental boron compound. It has attracted wide attention for its unique electronic structure. Several of its derivatives are useful reagents.\n\n[reaction]\nReaction may refer to a process or to a response to an action, event, or exposure.",

      "raw": "The correct answer is 3. Didecilborane.\nThis reaction, known as a borane-alumina reduction, involves the addition of diborane (B2H6) to an alkene such as 1-deceno, resulting in the formation of a boron compound where each carbon atom from the decene chain is bonded to one boron atom. The number of carbons in the original alkene minus two equals the number of hydrogen atoms lost in the reaction, thus forming didecilborane (C10H12B2)."

      "context": "[gases]\nGas is a state of matter with neither fixed volume nor fixed shape. It is a compressible form of fluid, in contrast to a liquid. A pure gas consists of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), or molecules (e.g. oxygen (O2) or carbon dioxide). Pure gases can also be mixed together such as in the air. What distinguishes gases from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation can make some gases invisible to the human observer.\n\n[respect]\nRespect, also called esteem, is a positive feeling or deferential action shown towards someone or something considered important or held in high esteem or regard. It conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities. It is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.\n\n[nobles]\nNobility is a social class found in many societies that have an aristocracy. It is normally appointed by and ranked immediately below royalty. Nobility has often been an estate of the realm with many exclusive functions and characteristics. The characteristics associated with nobility may constitute substantial advantages over or relative to non-nobles or simply formal functions, and vary by country and by era.

This trend can be explained by the strength of the leaving group, with a more stable leaving group facilitating the reaction. The sequence given follows this trend. For example, the carboxylate ion (COO-) is a stronger base and thus a better leaving group than ammonia (NH3) or chloride (Cl-), so the ester (R-COOR') is more stable than the amide (R-CONH2). The acid chloride (R-COCl) is the most reactive due to the highly electronegative chlorine, which facilitates the leaving of the Cl- ion."
